# Inappropriate-Content-Detection

#Developed a content moderation system in Python by fine-tuning a pre-trained GPT-2 model with LoRA to detect and reduce offensive or harmful language in private messages. Utilized Hugging Face and Kaggle datasets along with their tools to train and evaluate a text classification model for inappropriate content detection, enhancing accuracy and efficiency with CUDA for accelerated computing to ensure rapid and reliable content moderation.
